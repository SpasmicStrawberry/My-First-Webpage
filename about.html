                    We, Brampton Association of Chinese Performing Arts was founded in 
                    May 2019.  Our current members come from more than ten countries 
                    and regions. Our mission is “To become happy and healthy through 
                    dancing”. In the past year, we learned more than 30 dances and songs, 
                    and we were invited to perform in a few multi-culturual events in 
                    Toronto Nathan Philip Square, and GTA area. We successfully launched 
                    an art performance in Kennedy Square in December 2019, which 
                    attracted hundreds of local residents. The president of our 
                    organization is Jennifer Lemon, the vice president is Julia Li. 
                    There is a five people committee board. The president, vice president 
                    and committee members are  well-educated professionals from all 
                    fields with outstanding leadership and organization skills. 
                    Currently we have a dancing team and a singing team with a total 
                    of 56 registered members. Team of TaiJi and team of model show are
                    in process.
